## Registration

The first step for using the payment API is to register as a Chillr for Business merchant. To do that you can contact our team at **email-id**.

Once registration is complete and your documentation is verified you will be provided with login access to the Chillr Business portal. You will be provided with an API key and will be able to generate the API secret token.

The Merchant also needs to provide a re-direct URL to which the page should re-direct once a transaction is completed.
